## The Collection of Database and Dataset Resources in Materials Science
This collection includes the list of online and offline resources of physical, chemical, mechanical and all other properties of materials.

Helping the students or enthusiasts who seek necessary data to practice machine learning techniques is the main motivation of this collection. It is also expected to assist the researchers in the material informatics field.

In the first three sections below, you can find the list of databases and dataset-sharing platforms accessible publicly and the information of the books/handbooks including materials data.

Additionally, in the last section, there are couple of toy datasets shared by researchers for educational purposes of machine learning techniques in materials science.
